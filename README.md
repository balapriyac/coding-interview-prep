## Books and Resources
I find the following resources quite helpful in my prep:

1. Elements of Programming Interviews
2. Cracking the Coding Interview

A couple good resources to brush up Python skills:

1. CS50 Python
2. Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python

I've started working through Blind 75. Here's my progress:
